		<h1>League of Legends Rocks</h1>
		<p>League of Legends (abbreviated LoL or just League) is a multiplayer online battle arena, real-time strategy video game developed and published by Riot Games for Microsoft Windows[1] and Mac OS X. It is a free-to-play game supported by microtransactions and inspired by the mod Defense of the Ancients[2] for Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne.</p>

		<p>In League of Legends, players assume the role of an unseen "summoner" that controls a "champion" with unique abilities and battle against a team of other players or computer-controlled champions. The goal is usually to destroy the opposing team's "nexus", a structure which lies at the heart of a base protected by defensive structures. Each League of Legends match is discrete, with all champions starting off fairly weak but increasing in strength by accumulating items and experience over the course of the game.</p>
